# Agent Registry — Dependency Graph & Tier Template

This file provides detailed dependency resolution information for the STDF pipeline orchestrator. The canonical Agent Registry table lives in CLAUDE.md — this file supplements it with execution details.

## Tier Execution Template

When building the execution plan, use this template. Delete tiers not needed by the chosen preset.

| Tier | Agents | Parallel? | Depends On |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | domain-disruption, cost-researcher, capability | Yes | — |
| 2 | cost-fitter | No | cost-researcher |
| 3 | cost-parity-checker, capability-parity-checker, adoption-readiness-checker | Yes | cost-fitter, capability, domain-disruption |
| 4 | tipping-synthesizer | No | all 3 checkers |
| 5a | scurve-fitter | No | tipping-synthesizer + cost-fitter |
| 5b | regional-adopter, xcurve-analyst | Yes | scurve-fitter |
| 6a | demand-decomposer | No | scurve-fitter + domain-disruption |
| 6b | stream-forecaster | No | demand-decomposer |
| 6c | fleet-modeler, regional-demand-analyst | Yes | stream-forecaster (+ regional-adopter for regional-demand) |
| Final | synthesizer | No | all selected outputs |

## Preset → Agent Resolution

**FULL** resolves to 12 agents (Tiers 1–5b + Final):
domain-disruption, cost-researcher, capability, cost-fitter, cost-parity-checker, capability-parity-checker, adoption-readiness-checker, tipping-synthesizer, scurve-fitter, regional-adopter, xcurve-analyst, synthesizer

**QUICK** resolves to 3 agents (Tier 1 partial + Tier 2 + Final):
cost-researcher, cost-fitter, synthesizer

**TIPPING_ONLY** resolves to 9 agents (Tiers 1–4 + Final):
domain-disruption, cost-researcher, capability, cost-fitter, cost-parity-checker, capability-parity-checker, adoption-readiness-checker, tipping-synthesizer, synthesizer

**COST_FOCUS** resolves to 4 agents:
cost-researcher, capability, cost-fitter, synthesizer

**ADOPTION_FOCUS** resolves to 12 agents (same as FULL — adoption needs tipping first):
domain-disruption, cost-researcher, capability, cost-fitter, cost-parity-checker, capability-parity-checker, adoption-readiness-checker, tipping-synthesizer, scurve-fitter, regional-adopter, xcurve-analyst, synthesizer

**FULL+COMMODITY** adds 4 agents to FULL (16 total):
FULL agents + demand-decomposer, stream-forecaster, fleet-modeler, regional-demand-analyst
